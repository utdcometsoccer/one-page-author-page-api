Console application for seeding the OnePageAuthor database with initial author, book, and article data for development and testing purposes.

## 🚀 Overview

SeedAPIData provides a reliable way to initialize your OnePageAuthor system with sample data including:

- **Author Profiles**: Sample author information with biographies and metadata
- **Book Catalog**: Demo book entries with covers, descriptions, and publication details  
- **Article Content**: Sample blog posts and article content
- **Social Media Links**: Author social media profiles and connections
- **Relationships**: Proper linking between authors, books, and articles

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Runtime**: .NET 9 Console Application
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB integration
- **Dependencies**: OnePageAuthorLib for data access services
- **Configuration**: User Secrets for secure connection strings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Access to OnePageAuthor Azure Cosmos DB
- Proper connection string configuration

### Running the Seeder
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd SeedAPIData

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the seeder
dotnet run
```

### Configuration
Set up your database connection using user secrets:
```bash
# Set Cosmos DB connection string
dotnet user-secrets set "CosmosDbConnectionString" "your-cosmos-connection-string"

# Set database configuration
dotnet user-secrets set "DatabaseId" "OnePageAuthorDB"
```

## 📋 Sample Data

The seeder creates the following sample entities:

### Authors
- Multiple author profiles with biographical information
- Professional headshots and cover images  
- Social media profiles and website links
- Geographic and demographic diversity

### Books
- Fiction and non-fiction titles
- Complete metadata (ISBN, publication dates, descriptions)
- Cover images and promotional materials
- Author-book relationships

### Articles  
- Blog posts and articles
- Various content categories and tags
- Publication dates and reading time estimates
- Author attribution and cross-references

## 🔧 Usage

### Safe Operation
- The seeder can be run multiple times safely
- Existing records will be updated rather than duplicated
- Includes verification and rollback capabilities
- Provides detailed logging of all operations

### Verification  
After running the seeder:
1. Check Cosmos DB containers for new records
2. Verify data integrity and relationships
3. Test API endpoints with seeded data
4. Review logs for any errors or warnings

### Sample Output
